      <description>rust-keylock is a password manager and its goals are to be:
 Secure Simple to use Portable Extensible  The core logic is written in Rust, but the presentation/User interaction parts are in different languages.
Features Security  The data is locked with a user-defined master password, using bcrypt password hashing Encryption using AES with CTR mode Data integrity checks with SHA3 (Keccak) Encrypted bytes blending Passwords are kept encrypted in memory Encryption keys on runtime are stored in safe, non-swappable memory Encryption keys change upon saving, even if the user master password remains the same.</description>
