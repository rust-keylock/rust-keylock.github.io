      <description>What is the rust-keylock? rust-keylock is a password manager.
What is the license? rust-keylock is a free software, licensed under GPLv3.
Where is the code? The code is hosted on GitHub.
Why so many GitHub repos? The idea is that there is a core rust-keylock library that handles the core application logic, whereas the interaction with the Users is done via libraries that have presentation responsibilities.
Therefore, apart from the core library repo, the rest are presentation libraries.</description>

      <description>rust-keylock is a password manager and its goals are to be:
 Secure Simple to use Portable Extensible  The core logic is written in Rust, but the presentation/User interaction parts are in different languages.
Features Security  The data is locked with a user-defined master password, using bcrypt password hashing Encryption using AES with CTR mode Encrypted bytes blending Passwords are kept encrypted in memory Encryption keys on runtime are stored in safe, non-swappable memory Encryption keys change upon saving, even if the user master password remains the same.</description>
