      <description>Release 0.7.0 is out!
rust-keylock-ui and rust-keylock-android now use the j4rs rust crate for the Java &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Rust communication, allowing to ditch the JNA dependency. Using j4rs in Android is pretty important for publishing the app in the F-Droid as well, since there is no need to carry the JNA pre-built binaries any more.
Moreover, ther is now asynchronous support provided by the rust-keylock-lib. It is being used by both rust-keylock-ui and rust-keylock-android.</description>
